1)We are using Alib tool for simulation.Alib is python based tool used for implementing VNE algorithm.

2)you need python 2.7 and pip2 for simulating this tool

3)so after downloading the directory run the following command to setup environment for simulation
    $ pip install .
    $pip install -e . (if codebase is edited)
    
4)libraries required for simulation are mentioned in "dev-requirements.txt"

5)After setting the environment succesfully run the "app.py" file to run the algorithm
